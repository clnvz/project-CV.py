Hello! This is where I compile all the programs I have done making as I self-learn Python!

Project ideas came from a Udemy course (100 Days of Python by Angela Yu)
NOTE:
	- I always code by my own first and only refer to Inst. Angela's solution strictly AFTER finishing the program/task.
	- I only look at Inst. Angela's solution to improve my coding skills (line reduction, proper structure, systematic process)
	- I can remake and explain everything in here.

Skills learned: 
 #1 OOP (starts on Day 16 onwards)
 #2 pandas (starts at Day 25)
 #3 list/dict comprehension
 #4 tkinter(GUI) (starts at Day 27)
